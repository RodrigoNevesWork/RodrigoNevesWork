  Hi, Iâ€™m @RodrigoNevesWork and this is my account for my projects in this journey of learning to Program.
  My central point of study is Kotlin but I also have knowledge in Java, C, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS and for Data Bases I worked with ElasticSearch and MongoDb.
  I'm a student of Computer Science in ISEL, Lisbon currently at my second year. After several group projects(Arkanoid, Chess App, WebApp...) that envolve the use of several       
  programing techniques, Data Structures and Alghoritms I decided to creat this account to program in my spare time and if for some reason someone sees this I am more than open 
  for their input, tips or anything related to any project that I have here.
 
   For any Contact my email is: rodrigofneves2000@gmail.com
