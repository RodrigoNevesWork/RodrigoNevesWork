  Hi, Iâ€™m @RodrigoNevesWork and this is my account for my projects in this journey of learning to Program.
  I have knowledge in Java, C, JavaScript,TypeScript, HTML and CSS. For SQL DataBases I used PostgreSQL and for NoSQL I used ElasticSearch, MongoDB,Firebase and Firestore.
  I'm a student of Computer Science in ISEL, Lisbon currently at my last year. After several group projects(Arkanoid, Chess App, BattleShip ...) that envolve the use of several programing techniques, Data Structures and Alghoritms. I decided to creat this account to program in my spare time and if for some reason someone sees this I am more than open for their input, tips or anything related to any project that I have here.
   For any Contact my email is: rodrigofneves2000@gmail.com
