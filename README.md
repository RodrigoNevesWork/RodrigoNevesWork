  Hi, Iâ€™m @RodrigoNevesWork and this is my account for my projects in this journey of learning to Program.
  I have knowledge in Kotlin, Java, GO, Python, C, JavaScript,TypeScript, HTML and CSS. For SQL DataBases I used PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLServer and for NoSQL I used ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Firebase and Firestore.
  I'm a Masters student of Computer Science and Engineer at NOVA School Of Science & Technology and a Developer at the eSIM Team in at Vodafone. After several group projects(Arkanoid, Chess App, BattleShip ...) that envolve the use of several programing techniques, Data Structures and Alghoritms I decided to publish here to see my progress. I decided to creat this account to program in my spare time and if for some reason someone sees this I am more than open for their input, tips or anything related to any project that I have here.
   For any Contact my email is: rodrigofneves2000@gmail.com
